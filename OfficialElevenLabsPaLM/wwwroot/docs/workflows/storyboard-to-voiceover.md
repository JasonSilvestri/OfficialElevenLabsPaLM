# Storyboard → Voiceover Mapping

## Concepts
- **Scene (SC)** → high-level moment in the story.
- **Shot (SH)** → camera viewpoint within a scene.
- **Narration Block (NB####)** → 1–2 sentence audio unit aligned to SH timing.

## Mapping Table (example)
| SC  | SH  | NB     | Role     | Target Emotion | Clone/Preset            | Notes                      |
|-----|-----|--------|----------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 01  | 01  | NB0001 | Narrator | Warm           | Jason–Warm v2 / Warm    | Opening line, gentle pace  |
| 01  | 02  | NB0002 | Narrator | Cinematic      | Jason–Cinematic v2      | Build-in, longer arc       |
| 01  | 03  | NB0003 | Hero     | Urgent         | Jason–Urgent v2         | Cut on beat with SFX       |

## Authoring Guidelines
- Write NB text with emotion encoded in **wording** and **punctuation** (quotes, dashes, ellipses).
- Avoid stage directions in the TTS input; keep those in notes or project fields.
- Keep NBs independent; no unresolved clauses across files.
